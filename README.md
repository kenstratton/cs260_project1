## Modeling a bag of marbles

### A way of representing marbles
Marble class represents each marble, and Map class takes a role of bag storing marbles.

### A way to add new marbles into the bag
An initial number of marbles are declared, and a marble creation method generates marbles into a bag.

### A way to remove a marble out of the bag.
A marble deletion method deletes a marble from a bag with a key that detects a location of a marble.

### A way to check the implementation should be working correctly (tests)
There would be three tests using assert method:
1. check a bag is empty at the bigening.
2. check marbles can be added appropriately.
3. check a certain marble can be searched with a key.
4. check a certain marble can be deleted.
